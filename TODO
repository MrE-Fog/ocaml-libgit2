The correct way to do this is to use menhir to read off the git source
code headers, create the tokens, then based off those tokens create an
AST then print that AST out, then compile that auto generated code.

Then that autogenerated code can be an ocaml package for usage on
ocamlfind and opam. Of course the library would need to have tests as
well, using ounit.
